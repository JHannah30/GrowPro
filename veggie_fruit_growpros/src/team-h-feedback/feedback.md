## Initial Thoughts on the App

We really liked your website, it looked really clean and served the function it was intended to do. Your components were really easy to see and the design and colour scheme looked great

## Trying to Understand your Code

Component tree is really nice and clean, very easy to read, understand, and follow.
(make sure you spell your folder names correctly! e.g. when rendering page make sure to change popup to PopUp as this stopped us from being able to see the page rendered).

Your naming conventions were clear and easy to understand, as was most of your code. That being said, some more comments could have been useful for other people looking through your code.

Make sure to delete or comment out console.logs just to keep the code clean (e.g. in your weather page)
